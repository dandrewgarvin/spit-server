# Spit App

This application is the backend service for the revived Spit app.

Spit is a social game-watching application that allows players to enhance their enjoyment of watching live sports (or esports) by being prompted with questions throughout the game, and allowing them to guess what will happen next.

In a football game, the prompt may appear asking who will the Quarterback throw the ball too, with the answers "QB Passes to WR", "QB Runs the ball", "Incomplete Pass", "Interception". Players will cast their votes, and when the play is made, the games curator will submit the correct answer, and players who got it right will receive an increased score.

Players can compete with their friends by trying to get the highest score in a game possible.
